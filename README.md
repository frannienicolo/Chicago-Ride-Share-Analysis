# Chicago-Ride-Share-Analysis

Please check out this project I completed for my Triple Ten Data Science Class!

For this project, I used SQL to preprocess my data before using Python to code and create exploratory data visualizations with the goal of analyzing the current ride-share market in Chicago. This information gathered from my analysis will be used to inform the company "Zuber", an up-and-coming ride-share company, on current trends both among taxi companies and clients in Chicago.
